  <p>I am a third-year undergraduate studying Computer Science, Mathematics & Music at Cornell University with a concentration in Programming Languages (PL).
    I'll be applying to graduate programs next cycle. I love research, teaching and building software!
    My interests lie in programming languages, compilers, formal verification and turning these into tools for building correct, efficient software.
  </p>
    
  <p>Professionally, I work heavily within fullstack development. I also dabble in algorithms and competitive programming.</p>

  <p>I am a strong believer that CS is at its best when used hand-in-hand with other areas. I am always searching new for ways to integrate fields ranging from music to ornithology!</p>

  <h2>Research &amp; Work Experience</h2>

  <p>
    I research programming language theory, formal verification and computer architecture abstractions at CAPRA,
    where I am fortunate to be advised by Adrian Sampson and Anshuman Mohan.
    My research spans PL and computer networks, entering the fascinating realm of programmable packet scheduling.
    I work on developing programming languages &amp; hardware for packet scheduling, with my specific research verifying 
    the correctness of our compilers.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a senior member, developer & frontend lead on Cornell's CMSX research & project team, where I am fortunate to be advised by Andrew Myers
    and work alongside a team of fantastic colleagues. I primarily work on developing better systems for student-staff interaction and maximizing the efficiency of UI.
  </p>

  <p>I worked for two years as a data analyst & software engineer at the Cornell Lab Of Ornithology, on the Merlin project.</p>

  <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

  <p>I have spent two years as Head Teaching Assistant of Cornell's foundational course in functional programming, advanced data structures and programming langauges.
    I am fortunate to work with Michael Clarkson, under whose guidance I have coauthored multiple assignments, labs and recitation material, taught hundreds of students
    and led three generations of course staff.
  </p>
    
  <p>I priorly served as the lead mentor &amp; curriculum developer at CodeForFun's HackHighSchool program.</p>
  <p>I have founded and tutored several educational programs in fundamentals of programming and computer science.</p>
  
  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <ul>
  
    <li><strong>Franz</strong> – A compiled programming language targeted towards compact and modular musical composition, using a text-based musical notation. Compiles to ChucK, an audio production and representation language.</li><br>
    
    <li><strong>KLaTsL</strong> – A programming language for linear algebra. Explores the idea of a dimensional type system, and presents syntax including matrix comprehensions and typechecked transformations.</li><br>

    <li><strong>FindYourBird</strong> – A Bird ID and information targeted towards amateur ornithologists around California, allowing users to search, identify, read about and post information and photos about birds around them. </li><br>

    <li><strong>Saberchat</strong> – A platform targeted towards centralizing communities and their networks. Lets users quickly share &amp; access information, and presents multiple features for community organizations.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Outside Work</h2>

  <p>I am an avid <a href="https://ebird.org/ebird/profile/MTY4NDM1Mg/world">birdwatcher</a> and wildlife photographer, and sometimes post my photos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kbirdpics/">online.</a></p>

  <p>I play the piano and guitar, and used to play the violin a lot though not as much anymore. I have also dabbled in Indian Carnatic and Indonesian Gamelan music.</p>
    
  <p>I also enjoy composing and arranging music.</p>

  <p>I enjoy biking, cooking, baking, soccer and cricket.</p>
