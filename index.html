      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>I am a third-year undergraduate student, researcher &amp; software developer studying Computer Science, Mathematics & Music at <a target="_blank" href="https://cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> with a concentration in <a target="_blank" href="https://pl.cs.cornell.edu/">Programming Languages (PL)</a>.
        I'll be applying to graduate programs next cycle. I love research, teaching and building software!
        My interests lie in programming languages, compilers, formal verification and turning these into tools for building correct, efficient software.
      </p>
        
      <p>Professionally, I work with fullstack development, and dabble in algorithms, machine learning &amp; competitive programming.</p>

      <p>I am a strong believer that CS is at its best when used hand-in-hand with other areas. I am always searching new for ways to integrate fields ranging from music to ornithology!</p>

      <h2>Research &amp; Work Experience</h2>

      <p>
        I research programming language design, formal verification and computer architecture abstractions at <a target="_blank" href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/">CAPRA</a>,
        where I am fortunate to be advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/">Adrian Sampson</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~amohan/">Anshuman Mohan</a>.
        My research spans PL and computer networks, entering the fascinating realm of programmable packet scheduling.
        I work on developing programming languages &amp; hardware for packet scheduling, with my current work involving mechanizing  proofs of compiler correctness.
        I am an open-source contributor to the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.calyxir.org/">Calyx compiler infrastructure</a>.
        I have also served as a <a target="_blank" href="https://cis.cornell.edu/students/bure-bowers-cis-undergraduate-research-experience">BURE</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://cis.cornell.edu/association-computer-science-undergraduates">ACSU</a> representative for my lab.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a senior member, developer & frontend lead on Cornell's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/cms/cmsx/">CMSX</a> research & project team, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/">Andrew Myers</a>
        and work alongside a team of fantastic colleagues. I primarily work on developing better systems for student-staff interaction and maintaining efficient UI software.
      </p>

      <p>I worked for two years as a data analyst & software engineer at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/">Cornell Lab Of Ornithology</a>, on the Merlin project,
        where I worked on image classification, data cleaning software and curated database profiles for hundreds of species splits.
      </p>

      <p>I worked for a year as an applied machine learning reseacher at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.asdrp.org/">ASDRP</a>,
        where I developed models applying supervised learning techniques to image-based water quality analysis.
      </p>

      <h2>Teaching Experience</h2>

      <p>I have spent two years as Head Teaching Assistant of Cornell's foundational <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2024fa/">course</a> in functional programming, advanced data structures and programming languages.
        I am fortunate to work with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/michael-clarkson">Michael Clarkson</a>, under whose guidance I have coauthored assignments, labs and recitation material, taught hundreds of students
        and led three generations of course staff.
      </p>
        
      <p>I previously worked as the lead mentor &amp; curriculum developer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codeforfun.com/AboutUs">CodeForFun's</a> HackHighSchool program, where I 
        led instruction in Java programming, Python development and full-stack development.</p>
      <p>I have founded and tutored several educational programs in fundamentals of programming and computer science.</p>
      
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      
        <p><strong><a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/KabirSamsi/franz">Franz</a></strong>: A programming language &amp; compiler targeted towards compact and modular musical composition, using a text-based musical notation. Compiles to ChucK, an audio production and representation language.</p>
        
        <p><strong><a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/KabirSamsi/KLaTsL">KLaTsL</a></strong>: A programming language for linear algebra. Explores the idea of a dimensional type system, and presents syntax including matrix comprehensions and typechecked transformations.</p>

        <p><strong><a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/KabirSamsi/find-your-bird">FindYourBird</a></strong>: A Bird ID and information for amateur ornithologists around California, allowing users to search, identify, read about and post information and photos about birds around them. </p>

        <p><strong><a target="_blank"  href="https://github.com/Saberchat/saberchat">Saberchat</a></strong>: A platform used to centralize communities and their networks. Lets users quickly share &amp; access information, and presents multiple features for community organizations.</p>

      <h2>Outside Work</h2>

      <p>I am an avid <a target="_blank" href="https://ebird.org/ebird/profile/MTY4NDM1Mg/world">birdwatcher</a> and wildlife photographer, and sometimes post my photos <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kbirdpics/">online</a>.
        I previously had a birdwatching blog which I will (hopefully) migrate here soon.
      </p>

      <p>
        I play the piano and guitar, and used to play the violin a lot though not as much anymore.
        I have also dabbled in Indian Carnatic and <a target="_blank" href="https://music.cornell.edu/gamelan">Indonesian Gamelan</a> music.
        I occasionally compose and arrange music.
      </p>

      <p>I enjoy biking, cooking, baking, soccer and cricket.</p>
